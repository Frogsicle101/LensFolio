### Changes
(summarise what task has been done, and what changes have been made)

### DoD
 - [ ] Acceptance Criteria met
 - [ ] Tests are written - including edge cases and non-blue sky scenarios
 - [ ] Documentation - class and Javadoc, and comments where code is unclear (try to make it clear if possible). Getters and setters do not need Javadoc
 - [ ] No commented-out blocks of code
 - [ ] No unused imports
 - [ ] No merge conflicts with target branch (Gitlab should tell you this near the merge button)

 ### Review
 - [ ] Acceptance criteria are met. Refer to the ScrumBoard task to find the acceptance criteria
 - [ ] Documentation is clear
 - [ ] Test coverage includes methods other than getters and setters
 - [ ] Tests cover a wide variety of cases
 - [ ] Try to break the implementation
 - [ ] Write feedback on your findings - including both positive and constructive points.
